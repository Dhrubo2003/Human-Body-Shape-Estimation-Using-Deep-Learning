# Human-Body-Shape-Estimation-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for human body shape classification. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to classify human body shapes based on the Fashion Human Body dataset. Understanding body shapes is crucial in the fashion industry for providing personalized recommendations and improving the overall shopping experience.

# Features

# Data Preprocessing:

1) Comprehensive preprocessing of the Fashion Human Body dataset to prepare it for model training.
2) Handling data augmentation, normalization, and other preprocessing techniques to enhance model generalization.

# Deep Learning Models:

1) Implementation of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and/or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for body shape classification.
2) Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to boost model performance.

# Training and Evaluation:

1) Training the models on the Fashion Human Body dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
2) Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance.

# Model Interpretability:

1) Techniques for visualizing and interpreting model predictions to understand which features contribute most to the body shape classification.

# Dataset
The project utilizes the Fashion Human Body dataset, which contains images of human body poses with annotated body shapes. The dataset can be obtained from [link-to-dataset].
